# Define prompt for GPT-4
prompt = (

    f"2. Stock price data: {formatted_stock_data}\n"
    f"3. Industry share: {stock_industry}\n"
    f"4. Date: {time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}\n"
    f"5. Reference: https://tw.stock.yahoo.com/quote/{stockNo}.TW\n"
    f"6. Latest K value: {kd_value['K_value']}\n"
    f"7. Latest D value: {kd_value['D_value']}\n\n"
    f"Tasks for you:\n"
    f"1. Review news from the top 5 companies influencing {stockNo} over the past 2 days across credible sources online.\n"

    f"4. Look up today's technical standards for {stockNo} across credible sources online.\n\n"
    f"Analysis criteria:\n"
    f"a. If KD < 20 and daily avg. volume > 20-day avg. volume, advise me to 'prepare to buy'.\n"
    f"b. If KD > 90 and daily avg. volume < 20-day avg. volume, advise me to 'prepare to sell'.\n"
    f"c. If 20 < KD < 90 and daily avg. volume > 20-day avg. volume, advise 'continue to observe'.\n"
    f"d. If KD > 80 and daily avg. volume > 20-day avg. volume, advise 'high-end oscillation'.\n"
    f"e. If KD < 20 and daily avg. volume < 20-day avg. volume, advise 'low-end oscillation'.\n"
    f"f. If KD > 85 and today's lowest price < yesterday's, 'prepare to sell'. If the same for prior day, 'sell half'.\n"
    f"g. If KD < 20 and today's highest price > yesterday's, 'prepare to buy'. If the same for prior day, 'buy in'.\n"
    f"h. If KD > 85, stock hits daily upper limit, and today's volume is 3x the 20-day avg., 'sell half'.\n\n"
    f"Note: If there are no stock prices for today, this means the market has not opened yet. In that case, use the date of the latest stock price data as today's date.\n\n"
    f"Provide these results concisely:\n"
    f"1. Next opening price prediction: (Provide based on news, queried info, historical market data, and professional tech analysis) e.g., 1xx.x (TWD)\n"
